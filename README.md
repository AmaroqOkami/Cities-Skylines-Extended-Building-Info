# Cities-Skylines-Extended-Building-Info
#Extended building information#
Detailed building service information and level up progress. Also adds additional random building names and company descriptions. 

This mod should not conflict with any other mod since it only touches the UI. However, the level up progress bars won't be accurate if you use a mod which modifies the level up requirements. Also don't use together with the Proper Hardness mod, that already includes this. 

Click the little arrow above the descriptions to hide them. Press N to toggle the random names and descriptions on or off. 

Thanks to /u/Tpangolin for the starting list of building names. Contribute more names and company descriptions at the reddit link.
